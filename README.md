# Feed-the-foodie

## Description

We have created a website that helps the user come up with recipe ideas but also suggests nearby restaurants that would match the cuisine they're interested in. 

The application helps people find recipes they hadn't thought of before or restaurants they didn't know about.

## Credits

We used [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) to style this page and use their documentation for guidance

The original repo for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/MohammadKouchaki/Feed-the-foodie). The owner of this repo is no longer part of the project so it had to be cloned here in order to deploy the application. Please refer to the original repo for commit and branch history.
